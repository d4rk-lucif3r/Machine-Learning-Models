## About

This dataset has been taken from [Grouplens](http://www.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). It contains a small subset of the MovieLens dataset.
Here, I have made a recommender system using Boltzmann Machines for the MovieLens dataset. This is a very simple example of a Boltzmann Machine which can be used for recommending if a user likes or dislikes a movie.
